We find here a gorgeous Farming Sim, with stunning visuals, a familiar space to players of Animal Crossings and Stardew Valley with its tool wheel, crops, day-night cycle (or should I say night-day?), and plethora of activities. The most recent demo is worth looking into! And yes, you can pet the cat who sits right besides you on the bench as well as the other animals (and other creatures!) roaming your land!

Game recommended to play with a controller but there are plenty of pre-setup configrations for gaming with keyboard and mouse that work really well.


---{ Grind }---
☐ Nothing to grind
☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks
☐ Isn't necessary to progress
☑ Average grind level
☐ Too much grind
☐ You'll need a second life for grinding

Devs provide multitude of tools, resources, and tips early on, probably due to this being a demo and to give the player the opportunity to try out several of the already developed mechanics in place.


---{ Story }---
☐ No Story
☑ Some lore
☐ Average
☐ Good
☐ Lovely
☐ It'll replace your life

Cleverly, the game has provided a way to restrict the player from accessing other sections of town, probably due to their development stage by using an NPC to guard your farmland's exit while letting you roam free inside. Will update when more content is released.


---{ Game Time }---
Still progressing through the story, will update later.


---{ Price }---
☐ It's free!
☐ Worth the price
☐ If it's on sale
☐ If u have some spare money left
☐ Not recommended
☐ You could also just burn your money

Game is worth the price, as it looks a lot cleaner than most Indie games priced similarly. There's clearly a lot more effort and care placed into aspects such as artwork, gameplay, quality of life features that makes it stand out.


---{ Bugs }---
☐ Never heard of
☑ Minor bugs
☐ Can get annoying
☐ ARK: Survival Evolved
☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs

Encountered a minor bug by looking at the poor cat attempting for several minutes to pass right through a fence post. The poor thing.

Game is very fun, the visuals are quite appealing, and it just gives a very good sense of belonging even though its unlikely we can relate to being vampires. For now. 8/10.
